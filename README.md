## Motivation

Applying for jobs is time-consuming, and as a programmer we learn early, **DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF.**
Well when applying for jobs you do that over and over, typing your name, email, LinkedIn URL, etc repeatedly and it gets tiring.
EasyApply is a centeralized dashboard where users can store their commonly used application details and quickly copy them to the clipboard for easy pasting.

Use it with a second screen and watch how fast your muscle memory kicks into the locations of the "Copy to Clipboard" buttons.
