## Description 

EasyApply is a ReactJS application designed to streamline the job application process. Applying for jobs can be time-consuming, especially when you have to repeatedly enter the same information across different application platforms. EasyApply aims to simplify this process by providing a centralized platform where users can store their commonly used application details and quickly copy them to the clipboard for easy pasting.

## Features

- **Customizable Fields:** Users can add their own fields with any name and assign them values, allowing for flexibility in storing application information.
  
- **Customizable Order and Spacing** Order the fields and space them how you desire to help you get the most effecient mouse movements
  
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Each item added to the application list comes with a "Copy to Clipboard" button, enabling users to quickly copy the information and paste it into various application forms.
  
- **Time-Saving:** With EasyApply, users can have the application details open on a separate page, making it convenient to switch between the application form and the EasyApply interface to copy and paste information swiftly.

-**Ready for Next Time:** KeyEasy stores the amount of entires, order, and titles in local storage to save you time when you open it, but purposely does not save your input values for saftey.
